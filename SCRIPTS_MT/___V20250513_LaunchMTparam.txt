			#   DO NOT RUN TWO "FORCE" OR A "FORCE" AND A "KEEP" PROCESS AT THE SAME TIME USING SAME PRIMARY 
			#   It may cause prblm if externalSlantRangeDEM and maybe slantRangeMask are being modified by the first FORCE run.

# AMPLITUDE 
###########
4			# MLAMPLI, Multilooking factor for amplitude images reduction (used for coregistration - 4-6 is appropriate).

# COARSE COREG
##############
64        	# CCOHWIN, Coarse coreg window size (64 by default but may want less for very small crop). Can be set to 0 to skip coarse coreg when using god orbit sat such as TSX, TDX and Envisat
0.4			# COH, Coarse Coherence threshold coregistration 
24          # CCDISTANCHOR, Coarse registration range & az distance between anchor points [pix] (eg 24 for large img, 16 for medium and 2-8 for very small crops)

50			# LLRGCO, Lower Left Range coord offset for final interferometric products generation. Used in SinglePairNoUnwrap only for Shadow measurements
50			# LLAZCO, Lower Left Azimuth coord offset for final interferometric products generation. Used in SinglePairNoUnwrap only for Shadow measurements

4			# INTERFML, multilook factor for final interferometric products generation (to multiply to the LARGEST side of the pixel); when used with zoom, it is ML to apply to zoomed pixels
1			# FILTFACTOR, filtering factor for interfero (2 might be too strong when used with POWSPECSMOOTFACT filtering)
1			# POWSPECSMOOTFACT, Power spectrum filtering factor (for adaptative filtering) (0 = no filtering; 1 or less is possible though stronger)
2           # COHESTIMFACT, in pixels. Must be similar to INTERFML as far as it is not a ML higher than 5 or 7 non ML for instance. For ML1, if -le 1, will be forced to 2. 
			#    If INTERFML is larger than 5 or 7, limit anyway COHESTIMFACT to 5 or 7 (Remember: computations load goes as square of win size)

# MASK
#######

				# Mask for AMSTer Engine < 20230928: 1 = keep, 0 = mask. However, at unwrapping, 0-masked pixels are kept if their coh > COHCLNTHRESH 
				# Mask for AMSTer Engine > 20230928: 0 = keep, 1 = always mask, 2 = mask. However, at unwrapping, 2-masked pixels are kept if their coh > COHCLNTHRESH

# UNWRAPPING
############
SKIPno	# SKIPUW, SKIPno unwraps and geocode all products, SKIPyes skips unwrapping and geocode only available products, Mask geocode only ampli and coh (for mask generation)
SNAPHU	# UW_METHOD, Select phase unwrapping method (SNAPHU, CIS, DETPHUN1ONLY, DETPHUN2ONLY, DETPHUN1SNAPHU, DETPHUN2SNAPHU, DETPHUN1CIS, DETPHUN2CIS)

# if snaphu unwrapping:
1.2			# DEFOTHRESHFACTOR, Snaphu : Factor applied to rho0 to get threshold for whether or not phase discontinuity is possible. rho0 is the expected, biased correlation measure if true correlation is 0. Increase if not good. 
0.9			# DEFOCONST, Snaphu : Ratio of phase discontinuity probability density to peak probability density expected for discontinuity-possible pixel differences. Value of 1 means zero cost for discontinuity, 0 means infinite cost. Decrease if prblm. 
0.2			# DEFOMAX_CYCLE, Snaphu : Max nr of expected phase cycle discontinuity. For topo where no phase jump is expected, it can be set to zero. 
DEFO		# SNAPHUMODE, Snaphu : TOPO, DEFO, SMOOTH, or NOSTATCOSTS. 
ZoneMapYes	# ZONEMAP, if ZoneMapYes, it will create a map with the unwrapped zones named snaphuZoneMap. Each continuously unwrapped zone is numbered (from 1 to...)
0.00001		# ZONEMAPSIZE, Minimum size of unwrapped zone to map (in fraction of total nr of pixels)
300			# ZONEMAPCOST, Cost threshold for connected components (zones). Higher threshold will give smaller connected zones
50			# ZONEMAPTOTAL, Maximum number of mapped zones	

MultiSnaphuNo	# MULTIUWP, MultiSnaphuYes performs recursive snaphu unwrapping (need 4 params below). MultiUnwrapNo (or any other string) will perform single snaphu unwrapping

10			# NITMAX, Max total nr of iterations
0.0627		# COHMUWPTHRESH, coh threshold (between 0 and 1) below which it replaces the phase by white noise (corresponding mask will be produced). If set to 0, do not mask with white noise

# if snaphu or CIS unwrapping:
0.25	# COHCLNTHRESH, Coherence cleaning threshold. Snaphu gives 0 weight at pixels below that threshold. 
		# Moreover, if a mask is used, snaphu (or CIS) also unwraps 0-masked pixels (for AMSTer Engine < 20230928) or 2-masked pixels (for AMSTer Engine > 20230928)
		# if their coherence is above COHCLNTHRESH. 

# if CIS unwrapping:
0.1		# FALSERESCOHTHR, False Residue Coherence Threshold: higher is much slower. Use max 0.15 e.g. in crater  
3		# CONNEXION_MODE, number of times that connexion search radius is augmented when stable connections are found ; 0 search along all coh zone  
3		# BIASCOHESTIM, Biased coherence estimator range & Az window size (do not apply pix ratio)

3		# DETITERR, Number of iterations for detPhUn (Integer: 1, 2 or 3 is generally OK)
0.3		# DETCOHTHRESH, Coherence threshold

BOTH	# INTERPOL, interpolate the unwrapped interfero BEFORE or AFTER geocoding or BOTH.
