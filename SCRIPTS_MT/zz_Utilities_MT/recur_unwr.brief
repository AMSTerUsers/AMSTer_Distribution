# and complex*8 in Fortran) in the native byte order (big vs. little
# endian) of the system.

# Orbital radius (double, meters) or altitude (double, meters).  The
# radius should be the local radius if the orbit is not circular.  The
# altitude is just defined as the orbit radius minus the earth radius.
# Only one of these two parameters should be given.  
#ORBITRADIUS            7153000.0
#ALTITUDE               775000.0

EARTHRADIUS             6378000.0


# The baseline parameters are not used in deformation mode, but they
# are very important in topography mode.  The parameter BASELINE
# (double, meters) is the physical distance (always positive) between
# the antenna phase centers.  The along-track componenet of the
# baseline is assumed to be zero.  The parameter BASELINEANGLE_DEG
# (double, degrees) is the angle between the antenna phase centers
# with respect to the local horizontal.  Suppose the interferogram is
# s1*conj(s2).  The baseline angle is defined as the angle of antenna2
# above the horizontal line extending from antenna1 towards the side
# of the SAR look direction.  Thus, if the baseline angle minus the
# look angle is less than -pi/2 or greater than pi/2, the topographic
# height increases with increasing elevation.  The units of
# BASELINEANGLE_RAD are radians.
BASELINE                150.0
BASELINEANGLE_DEG       225.0
#BASELINEANGLE_RAD      3.92699


# If the BPERP parameter is given, the baseline angle is taken to be
# equal to the look angle (mod pi) at midswath, and the length of the
# baseline is set accordingly.  Particular attention must be paid to
# the sign of this parameter--it should be negative if increasing
# phase implies increasing topographic height.  
#BPERP          -150.0


# The transmit mode should be either REPEATPASS or PINGPONG if both
# antennas transmitted and both received (REPEATPASS and PINGPONG have
# the same effect); the transmit mode should be SINGLEANTENNATRANSMIT
# if only one antenna was used to transmit while both antennas
# received.  In single-antenna-transmit mode, the baseline is
# effectively halved.  This parameter is ignored for cost modes other
# than topography.
TRANSMITMODE    REPEATPASS


# Slant range from platform to first range bin in input data file
# (double, meters).  Be sure to modify this parameter if the input 
# file is extracted from a larger scene.  The parameter does not need 
# to be modified is snaphu is unwrapping only a subset of the input file.

# Equivalent number of independent looks (double, dimensionless) that were

# is ignored if the correlation data are generated by the interferogram

#
# The equivalent number of independent looks is approximately equal to the 
# real number of looks divided by the product of range and azimuth 
# resolutions, and multiplied by the product of the single-look range and 
# azimuth pixel spacings.  It is about 0.53 times the number of real looks 
# for ERS data processed without windowing.
NCORRLOOKS      23.8


# Number of looks that should be taken in range and azimuth for estimating
# the correlation coefficient from the interferogram and the amplitude 
# data.  These numbers must be larger than NLOOKSRANGE and NLOOKSAZ.
# The actual numbers used may be different since we prefer odd integer
# multiples of NLOOKSRANGE and NLOOKSAZ (long).  These numbers are ignored
