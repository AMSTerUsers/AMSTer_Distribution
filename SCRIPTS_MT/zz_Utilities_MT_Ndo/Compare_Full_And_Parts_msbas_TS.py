# The script aims at displaying the (double difference) time series of a msbas inversion performed in 2 parts. 
#
# If provided with a 3rd parameter, it will plot that time series as well. It can be either the
# result of the processing performed in one block instead of two parts, or the results from the 
# combination of block 1 and 2 as done for instance in Domuyo_S1_Step3_MSBAS_DEMGeoid_Split.sh
#
# The date provided as the first parameter will allow to draw a vertical line at the date of the middle 
# overlap, where block 1 and 2 were adjusted by Add_DefoMap_ToAllMapsInDir.py. 
# The figure is saved in the current directory as Part1_2.png (or Part1_2_Full.png if provided 
# with 3 files)
#
# This script allows to check that the 2 parts are correctly aligned. 
#
# Each file is a txt file resulting from PlotTS_all_comp.sh, hence made of 6 columns: 
# YYYYMMDD HHMMSS TS_pix1  YYYYMMDD HHMMSS TS_pix2
# Hence files must be pre-processed with fct process_file to get [date , col 6-3]
#
# Parameters:	- date of the middle overlap, where the offset is computed by 
#				- Path to the file with data from part 1 (e.g. timeLine_EW_1456_1947_1573_1976_Auto_2_0.04_LUX_PART1_OVERLAP_20200816.txt)
# 				- Path to the file with data from part 2 (e.g. timeLine_EW_1456_1947_1573_1976_Auto_2_0.04_LUX_PART2_OVERLAP_20200816.txt
#				  Note here that the data of part 2 were offset during the split msbas by the difference between defo map 
#				  in the middle of the overlap period. See Add_DefoMap_ToAllMapsInDir.py for more info.
#				- [Path to the file with data from the whole porcessing (e.g. timeLine_EW_1456_1947_1573_1976_Auto_2_0.04_LUX.txt)]
#  
# Remember: Part 1 and 2 are expected to overlap during 3 times the max Temporal baseline used
# for computing the interferograms (BT). Note that if max BT is short (i.e. equivalent of 
# only a small number of orbit cycles), then it is advised to take 1 year instead of BT 
# in the following reasoning. 
# This overlap is mandatory because the beginning and the end of msbas 
# time series are expected to be affected by the fact that there is not enough pairs linked  
# to each images comprised in that first and last period of BT (see x in fig below).
#
# begin   BT    BT    BT                            BT    BT    BT    end
#   |xxxxx|-----|-----|------- ...Part1... ---------|-----|ooooo|xxxxx|
#                                                            ^
#                                                         Mid Overlap
#                                                            v
# 												  begin   BT    BT    BT                            BT    BT    BT    end
